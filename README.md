## JOIN: Journal of Interactive Notebooks 
*2016-08-02*: </i>[Collection 2 now online!](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/join)</br>

*The Journal of Interactive Notebooks (JOIN) is an online repository of interactive Jupyter Notebooks where users can upload, share, and launch Notebooks in the cloud. JOIN is being developed by the Ma'ayan Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.*

## What are interactive notebooks?
Interactive notebooks are powerful tools that can be used for implementing reproducible research, reusing computational analysis methods, and encouraging collaboration between peers and reviewers. 

The Jupyter notebook is an open-source project that is language agnostic; in other words, it supports data analysis and computing across 40 different programming langages. The Jupyter notebook combines exectuable code with powerful visualization tools and narrative text, as well as a usable command-line interface.  While the volume of interactive notebooks has been steadily increasing, leading to more transparent and accessible data analysis methods, there is not yet a structure implemented to collate, review and publish these notebooks. 

## What are the features of JOIN?
JOIN combines the traditional publication format, containing abstracts, references, and methods, with the Jupyter Notebook interface, which offers a interactive web server containing machine-readable code and plain-text formatting. 

## What is a JOIN Collection?
Notebooks in JOIN are clustered into Collections which address a specific issue and method of analysis. Moreover, each notebook in a Collection is available to launch interactively in the cloud using Binder. In addition to reading the notebook statically with nbViewer, JOIN allows users to reproduce the analysis performed by the notebook's original generator, as well as add their own methods for further analysis and visualization. Users can also upload their own notebooks and collections to JOIN; notebooks are tagged with user-specified keywords, and are available to share.
